# SafetyMarkh
SafetyMarkh is an Android tool safety application,
developed by Benas Klastaitis for the Computer Science capstone at Macalester College.

The app reads QR codes for 28 different power tools used in the Studio Arts Department at Macalester College.
(The QR codes are stickers to be applied onto the power tools.) When the app recognizes a QR code,
it pulls up all of the relevant safety information from a safety manual, which was referenced by Macalester but authored by
the Louisiana State University (URL: http://design.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/designshopsafetymanual.pdf)

The app lacks youtube playback and the metal shop tool safety information.

To run: Download Android Studio. Run.
